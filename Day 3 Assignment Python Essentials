Question 1) Find sum of n numbers with help of while loop

Ans)n = int(input("enter a number"))
total_numbers = n
sum=0
while (n >= 0):
    sum += n
    n-=1
print ("sum using while loop ", sum)


Question 2) Take an integer and find it is prime or not

Ans)num = int(input("Enter a number"))

# To take input from the user
#num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# prime numbers are greater than 1
if num > 1:
# check for factors
for i in range(2,num):
if (num % i) == 0:
print(num,"is not a prime number")
break
else:
print(num,"is a prime number")

# if input number is less than
# or equal to 1, it is not prime
else:
print(num,"is not a prime number")
